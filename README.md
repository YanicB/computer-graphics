# üß≠ SimpleView ‚Äî 3D Object Viewer

### OpenGL & C++ Implementation of Transformations and Hierarchical Modeling

---

## üß© Overview

**SimpleView** is a lightweight 3D graphics viewer built with **C++**, **OpenGL**, and **GLUT**.  
It allows users to create, transform, and view 3D objects using an interactive mouse and menu system.

The project demonstrates how translation, rotation, and scaling work across different coordinate systems ‚Äî Model, World, and View (Camera) ‚Äî while following an object-oriented design approach.

## ‚ú® Features

- **3D Object Rendering:** Cube, Pyramid, and House objects  
- **Transformations:**
  - Translation, rotation, and scaling in Model (MCS) and World (WCS) coordinates  
  - Camera rotation and translation in View (VCS) coordinates  
- **Hierarchical Modeling:** The House object is built by combining a cube and pyramid  
- **Interactive Controls:** Menu-based transformations and camera adjustments using the mouse  
- **Matrix Operations:** Custom 4√ó4 matrix class supporting transpose, normalization, and rotation  
- **Clean OOP Architecture:** Classes for Matrix, Vector, Shape, Camera, and World management

## üñ±Ô∏è Controls

Right-click anywhere in the OpenGL window to open the menu:

- **Reset** ‚Äì Restore initial camera and object positions  
- **Select Object** ‚Äì Choose between Cube, Pyramid, or House  
- **MCS Transformations** ‚Äì Rotate or scale an object in local coordinates  
- **WCS Transformations** ‚Äì Translate or rotate an object in world space  
- **VCS Transformations** ‚Äì Move or rotate the camera, or adjust near/far planes  

Mouse dragging applies the selected transformation.
